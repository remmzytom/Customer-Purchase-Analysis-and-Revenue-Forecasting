# Customer-Purchase-Analysis-and-Revenue-Forecasting

### Pre-requisite Skills: Python, Data Wrangling, Pandas, ARIMA, Data Visualization, Machine Learning Basics, Time Series Analysis

## Scenario
As a data analyst working for a retail company, my objective is to uncover insights from customer purchasing patterns and forecast future revenue. Using customer transaction data, my aim to identify frequent purchase behaviors, perform revenue time series analysis, and recommend products to customers based on their shopping history. This case will help decision-makers in retail optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and revenue generation.


## Introduction
Retail businesses generate a lot of transactional data, which needs efficient processing to uncover valuable insights and improve customer experience and revenue. In this project, Spark was used to handle the large dataset because of its ability to process data quickly and efficiently. Spark helped with tasks like filtering, grouping, and transforming data, making it ready for analysis.

The focus of this project is to understand customer buying habits, find frequently purchased items, and predict future revenue trends using data like transactions, product details, and revenue. By combining data analysis, machine learning, and prediction techniques, this project provides a clear way to improve retail operations and make better business decisions.
